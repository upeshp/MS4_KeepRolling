## Testing


_Code Validators_

All code passed validation tests from the [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validation websites.

For python code, I used the command 'python3 - m flake8' in the gitpod terminal to list out any PEP8 compliance issues: 
- The majority of these have been addressed, any issues remaining are those where it was difficult to change the code without impacting functionality, for example in migrations.py files.

_Speed_

I used [GT Metrix](https://gtmetrix.com/) to analyse the speed of the website, which gave an overall grade of B:
- There are some issues with the loading of the site, whilst there are some potential fixes to improve this, such as restructuring the code so the main image is loaded inline (as opposed to from the css file), as there is no material impact on site performance, and due to timing constraints, this has been left as a bug to fix in future development.

_Responsiveness_

I tested the website by changing the screen size on my display, and using the inspect function on developer tools to show how it looks on different devices.

I tested the website on various browsers/devices which were available to me.

It is noted that the homepage image on small screens isn't as visually appealing as on larger screens, as it focuses on the left-hand-side of the image. Also the gap between the hero-image content and the footer is quite narrow on smaller screens. These are bugs for future development, as site functionality is not impacted.

_Bugs_

- No seperate html template for courses/clothing, meaning searching brings back all items, regardless of category.
- Homepage image doesn't look ideal on very small screens.
- Navbar menu items on dropdown are quite small/close together on very small screens.
- No custom error 404/500 pages included.
- Lodaing speed could be improved upon.
- Although the styling has been kept minimal for a simple design, it is recognised further styling could be included to improve presentation of site, for example making more features red like the prices/buttons, or including animation effects for the product cards etc.
- Due to time constraints, the above will not be addressed in this version, but will be addressed in future versions of the site.
