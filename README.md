## Milestone 4 â€“ Keep Rolling Website

I am creating a website for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu enthusiasts to purchase instructionals/courses and clothing/merchandise.


## UX

_Overview_

The aim of the project is to create an ecommerce website where users can purchase items of their choice. 
The website is created for those who train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, who are often looking for courses/instructional material they can use to improve their game, especially in recent times where many are in lockdown, and unable to train Jiu Jitsu.
The website will also sell Jiu Jitsu merchandise, such as clothing they can use whilst training.
Users will want to easily be able to browse and purchase items, and the website owner will want to showcase their products postiviely to drive sales. 
The website is designed to be suitable for use on all devices, from desktop to mobile.

_5 S's_

**Strategy** 

The primary goal is to create a ecommerce website for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu enthusiasts to purchase instructionals/courses and clothing/merchandise.

**Scope** 

The overall look and feel of the website was influenced by researching similar websites (credits at end):
    -   These are simple/clean in design
    -   There is a hero image explaining the site's purpose, along wih some introductory text
    -   There is a menu where you can display product listings by category (usually on the navbar)
    -   There is an icon to login and/or display your shopping bag on the navbar
    -   Products are listed in a "grid" style with each product having it's own image and high-level description
    -   Clicking on the product image takes you to the product page with it's detailed description
    -   There is a search box to search for products (usually on the navbar)
    -   Selected items are placed in a "shopping bag" page where users can see items selected for purchase before confirming their buy
