## Milestone 4 – Keep Rolling Website

I am creating a website for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu enthusiasts to purchase instructionals/courses and clothing/merchandise.

## UX

_Overview_

The aim of the project is to create an ecommerce website where users can purchase items of their choice. 
The website is created for those who train Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, who are often looking for courses/instructional material they can use to improve their game, especially in recent times where many are in lockdown, and unable to train Jiu Jitsu.
The website will also sell Jiu Jitsu merchandise, such as clothing they can use whilst training.
Users will want to easily be able to browse and purchase items, and the website owner will want to showcase their products postiviely to drive sales. 
The website is designed to be suitable for use on all devices, from desktop to mobile. 
Due to timing constraints, I will be taking the approach of producing a minimum viable product for this project submission, with the aim of improving/further developing the site in the future.

_User Stories_

As a user of the site:

	*	I want to understand the website's purpose
	*	I want to be easily able to view a list of all products by category
	* 	I want to be able to view specific product details
	*	I want to be easily able to purchase products

As the site owner:

	* 	I want the website to provide a platform for users to purchase items
	*	I want to be able to add/edit/delete products

_5 S's_

**Strategy** 

The primary goal is to create a ecommerce website for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu enthusiasts to purchase instructionals/courses and clothing/merchandise.

**Scope** 

The overall look and feel of the website was influenced by researching similar websites (credits at end):
    -   These are simple/clean in design
    -   There is a hero image explaining the site's purpose, along wih some introductory text
    -   There is a menu where you can display product listings by category (usually on the navbar)
    -   There is an icon to login and/or display your shopping bag on the navbar
    -   Products are listed in a "grid" style with each product having it's own image and high-level description
    -   Clicking on the product image takes you to the product page with it's detailed description
    -   There is a search box to search for products (usually on the navbar)
    -   Selected items are placed in a "shopping bag" page where users can see items selected for purchase before confirming their buy

## Deployment

_Github_

The source code for this site is in GitHub.

To clone the code from GitHub:

1.	On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2.	Above the list of files, click Code.
3.	To clone the repository using HTTPS, click HTTPS under "Clone".
4.	Open Git Bash.
5.	Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
6.	Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier:
    ```$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/MS4_KeepRolling.git```
7.	Press Enter to create your local clone.
8.  Create your own env.py file to store variables, and ensure this is listed in your .gitignore file to keep these from being displayed publicly.

_Deployment to Heroku_

Heroku is used to deploy the app:

1.	When logged into your account, create new app:
    ![Picture1](static/readme-image/Picture1.png)

2.	Choose app name and your closest region:

	![Picture2](static/readme-image/Picture2.png) 

3.	On Resources tab, provision Heroku Postgres (use the free plan):

    ![Picture3](static/readme-image/Picture3.png) 
	 
4.	Back in gitpod, install the following via these commands:
	 - ```pip3 install dj database url```
	 - ```pip3 install psycopg2 binary```

5.	Freeze the requirements so this is updated in the requirements.txt file to make sure Heroku installs all apps when deployed:
	- ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```

6.	To get stores database setup, go to settings.py an import dj_database_url:

    ![Picture6](static/readme-image/Picture6.png) 

7.	Down in the databases setting, comment out default configuration and replace the default database with a call to dj_database_url.parse, and give it the database URL from Heroku in the brackets (from your config variables in your app settings tab):

    ![Picture7](static/readme-image/Picture7.png) 

8.	Now run all migrations again, by running:
	- ```python 3 manage.py migrate```

9.	Then create a superuser to log in with:
	- ```python3 manage.py create superuser```

10.	Back in settings.py remove the Heroku database config, and uncomment the original so our database URL doesn't end up in version control:
    
    ![Picture10](static/readme-image/Picture10.png) 

11.	Then commit to github.

12.	Use an if statement in settings.py, so when app is running on Heroku, where database URL environment variable is defined, we connect to Postgres, otherwise we connect to sqlite:
    
    ![Picture12](static/readme-image/Picture12.png) 

13. Install unicorn, which will act as our webserver, then freeze that into requirements.txt:
	- ```pip3 install gunicorn```
	- ```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```

14.	Now create Procfile, and enter the following to tell Heroku to create a web dyno, which will run unicorn and serve our django app:
	```web: gunicorn APP_NAME.wsgi:application```

15.	Temporarily disable collectstatic:
    
    ![Picture15](static/readme-image/Picture15.png) 

16.	Add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py, add localhost aswell:
	ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['YOUR-APP-NAME.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']

17.	Then add/commit changes to github.

18.	To deploy to Heroku, enter (you may need to initialize your Heroku git remote if you created your app on the website rather than the CLI):
    
    ![Picture18](static/readme-image/Picture18.png) 

19.	To automatically deploy on Heroku when we commit to github, on your Heroku dashboard go to Deploy > select Github, and search for your repository, then click Connect:
    
    ![Picture19](static/readme-image/Picture19.png) 

20.	Click to enable automatic deploys:
    
    ![Picture20](static/readme-image/Picture20.png) 

21.	You need a new secret key to enter in you Heroku Config Vars (you can use an online Django secret key generator to do this):
    
    ![Picture21](static/readme-image/Picture21.png) 

22.	Now you can replace the secret key in settings.py with a call to get this from the environment:
    
    ![Picture22](static/readme-image/Picture22.png) 

23.	Commit/push these changes to github.

_AWS_

AWS is a cloud based storage service, used to store static files and images:

1.	After creating an AWS account (using the free version will be sufficient), access the AWS management console in your account.

2.	Find s3 by searching for this in services.

3.	Open s3 and create a new bucket.

4.	Enter a name for your bucket/select your closest region.

5.	Uncheck the block public access box, and create the bucket.

6.	Once created, click on the bucket and enter the following settings:
	-	Under Properties, turn on static website hosting
	- 	Under Permissions, paste in the CORS configuration:
	```
        [
 		    {
     		    "AllowedHeaders": [
         		    "Authorization"
     			    ],
     		    "AllowedMethods": [
       			    "GET"
     			    ],
     		    "AllowedOrigins": [
         		    "*"
     			    ],
    		    "ExposeHeaders": []
 		    }
	    ] ```
    -	Go to the bucket policy tab and select, policy generator so we can create a security policy for this bucket.
    -	The policy type is going to be s3 bucket policy, allow all principals by using a star, and the action will be, get object
    -	Copy the ARN which stands for Amazon resource name from bucket policy tab and paste it into the ARN box here at the bottom, then click Add Statement, then click Generate Policy then copy this policy into the bucket policy editor.
    -	Before clicking Save, because we want to allow access to all resources in this bucket, add add a slash star onto the end of the resource key
    -	Go to the access control list tab, and set the list objects permission for everyone under the Public Access section

7.	With our s3 bucket ready to go. Now we need to create a user to access it. do this through another service called Iam which stands for Identity and Access Management.

8.	Go back to the services menu and open Iam

9.	Click groups then create a new group (keep clicking through to Create Group)

10.	Create the policy used to access our bucket by clicking policies and then create policy

11.	Go to the JSON tab and then select import managed policy, then search for s3 and then import the s3 full access policy

12.	Get the bucket ARN from the bucket policy page in s3, and paste that in the JSON section

13.	Now click review policy, give it a name and a description, and then click create policy

14.	Now attach the policy to the group we created, go to groups, click manage my group, click attach policy, search for the policy we just created and select it, and click attach policy

15.	Create a user to put in the group. On the user's page, I'll click add user, create a user, give them programmatic access, then select next

16.	Now add user to your group. Important: Now download the CSV file which will contain this users access key and secret access key which we'll use to authenticate them from our Django app (cannot access this again so do this now)

17.	To Connect Django to s3 bucket, Install 2 new packages:
    -	```pip3 install boto3```
    -	```pip3 install django-storages```

18.	Then freeze requirements:
    -	```pip3 freeze > requirements.txt```

19.	Add ‘storages’ to installed apps on settings.py

20.	To connect Django to s3 we need to add some settings in settings.py to tell it which bucket it should be communicating with:
 
21.	Go to Heroku and add our AWS keys to the config variables, aswell as adding that key called USE_AWS which I'll set to true

22.	Also remove the disable collectstatic variable

23.	In our settings file, we need to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production
    
    ![Picture23a](static/readme-image/Picture23a.png) 

24.	Create a file called custom storages:

    ![Picture24a](static/readme-image/Picture24a.png) 
 
25.	Go to settings.py, tell it that for static file storage we want to use our storage class we just created, and that the location it should save static files is a folder called static. Do the same thing for media files by using the default file storage and media files location settings

    ![Picture25a](static/readme-image/Picture25a.png) 

26.	Add/commit changes in github.
